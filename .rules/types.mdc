Use a mapper function to translate between the persistence models (entities) and the API/data transfer models (DTOs).

When importing types, always explicit declare as a type (e.g. import { type GetLocation } from 'xxx')

Persistence Model Types
- Use snake_case
- Use null types for undefined values.

DTO
- Use camelCase.
- Avoid null types, prefer undefined.
