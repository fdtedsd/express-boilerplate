Guideline for logging execution.

- Logs should describe what has happened, not what is going to happen.
- Log messages should be in the past tense.
- Always use a logger function, avoid console.log.
- Include relevant details like timestamp and IDs.
- When possible, add log level (debug, info, warn, error).
- Add the layer and function called in the log message.
- Do not add Personal Identifiers into logs.
